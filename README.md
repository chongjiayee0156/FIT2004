# Basic Algorithms and Data Structures

This repository contains my assignment attempts for an algorithms and data structures module in year 2 uni.

## Assignment 1

This assignment focuses on DP & Dijkstra:

**Question 1: Fast Food Chain**

Focuses on maximizing the total annual revenue by selecting optimal locations to build restaurants along a freeway, with the constraint that no two restaurants can be within a specified distance (d kilometers) of each other. It utilizes Dynamic Programming to find the maximum revenue and Backtracking to identify the selected restaurant sites.

**Question 2: Climb King**

Addresses the challenge of finding the shortest path from a starting point to any of the given exits in a floor graph, with the condition that the path must pass through at least one key. The solution employs Dijkstra's algorithm to find shortest paths and Backtracking to reconstruct the route.

# Assignment 2

This assignment focuses on Trie & Ford-Fulkerson algorithm:

**Question 1: Customized Auto-complete**

Implements an auto-complete feature using a Trie data structure. It loads a dictionary, builds a Trie for efficient prefix searching, and finds the highest frequency word matching a given prefix along with its definition and the total count of prefix matches.

**Question 2: A Weekend Getaway**

Solves a car allocation problem using the Maximum Flow algorithm (Ford-Fulkerson) with Circulation with Demand and Lower Boundaries. It models people and cars as a graph and determines a feasible allocation by finding the maximum flow through the network.
